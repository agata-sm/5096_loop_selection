These scripts can be used to select chromatin loops which comprise two regions which are the sole interactors of each other (i.e. do not interact with any other region).
The input is `bedgraph` file as output by `hicDetectLoops` from [hicexplorer](https://hicexplorer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/hicDetectLoops.html).
The script to annotate the selected loops with functional features requires output of [BEDOPS](https://bedops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
